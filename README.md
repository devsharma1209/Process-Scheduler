# Process-Scheduler
OS Project - Process Scheduler


- simulator that mimics how an OS schedules processes like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling
- compare your simulated results with real Linux processes


---


things to do rn:
1. update the table to get other details like TAT, Rspeonce time, WT ect. + Add Performance Metricsl like CPU Utilization (%) Throughput (processes per unit time) Context Switch Count (for Round Robin) ect.
2. add Shedulers like SJF, SRJF ect. + see any important or industry standard schedulers
3. generate gantt charts for all the schedulers
4. Better visulization - see how can i imporve the img of the gantt charts
5. Adv. - Implement ML to tell which is the best schedulers for the given workload
6. Document the entire process + create the ReadMe.md file
7. Gantt Chart Comparison Panel -  Show algorithms’ Gantt charts side by side + Highlight differences with colors and labels
8. Opt.  - Add Process Starvation Detector and then automatically apply aging mechanism
9. Opt. -  Mini Linux Task Manager (with Kill, Priority & Graphs)
10.
